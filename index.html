    <p class="paragraph-style">Prince would go on to become one of the most influential artists of the modern world due to his androgynous, hyper-sexual aesthetic and his masterful pop sensibilities. He's also known for his relentless work ethic and world class guitar technique.</p>
    <h3>Notable songs that also contributed to Prince's stardom:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>When Doves Cry</li>
      <li>Rasberry Beret</li>
      <li>Kiss</li>
      <li>Little Red Corvette</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Here is <a href="http://prince.org/">another website about Prince</a>. This website was clearly designed a long time ago. It features an overwhelming amount of information and is aesthetically tough to look at (not that my website is much better). On the plus side, there is a lot of information to browse through on this site.</p>
